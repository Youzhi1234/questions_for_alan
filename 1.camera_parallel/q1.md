# Description

Currently, cam.py reads frames from multiple cameras using a single thread.
The speed will be F/N, where F is the frame rate of a single camera and N is camera number.

To speed up multiple cameras, we try to use mutil-processing or thread to read frames from these camera concurrently, but we met some problems.

When we apply auto exposure
```bash
mvsdk.CameraSetAeExposureRange(self.hCamera,1*1000,10*1000)
```
The speed will stil be F/N, even if with mutil-processing or thread.
Multiple cameras will be speed up if we disable the auto exposure, but the auto exposure is important for us.

# camera install
1.Download camera driver [MVSDK.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dOPPfzYnEUw4YZTecg1AgWz3LiztlIDF/view)

2.Install the driver
```bash
unzip MVSDK.zip
cd MVSDK
sudo ./install.sh
```
Please refer to MVSDK/LinuxSDK Document.pdf if you meet any problem while installing.

3.To access the camera dirver, you need add "sudo" for every run. such as
```bash
sudo python cam.py
```
For convenient, you can add current user to the root to avoid add "sudo" for every time.

```bash
secUser=`who am i | awk '{print $1}'` 
sudo adduser $secUser root
sudo udevadm control --reload
sudo udevadm trigger
```
# Problem details
1. single thread single camera vs single thread four cameras
