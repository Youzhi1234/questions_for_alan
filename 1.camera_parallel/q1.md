# description

Currently, cam.py reads frames from multiple cameras using a single thread.
The speed will be F/N, where F is the frame rate of a single camera and N is camera number.

To speed up multiple cameras, we try to use mutil-processing or thread to read frames from these camera concurrently, but we met some problems.

When we apply auto exposure
```bash
mvsdk.CameraSetAeExposureRange(self.hCamera,1*1000,10*1000)
```
The speed will stil be F/N, even if with mutil-processing or thread.
Multiple cameras will be speed up if we disable the auto exposure, but the auto exposure is important for us.
