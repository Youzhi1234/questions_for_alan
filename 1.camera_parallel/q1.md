# Problem 1
These cameras are 1944x2592 with 59FPS.The resolution is too high, but the speed is too low.

I tried to apply a ROI binning to disable some pixels on the CMOS. But it will hurt the view filed of the camera.

We need to buy new cameras ,if we can not low down the resolution of the CMOS without view filed reduction. 
# Problem 2
Mutil-cameres are hard to parallel, beacuse they will share the exposure time. 

Despite the read time, the speed:
one_cam = four_cams (single_processor) = four_cams (Mutil_processors)
## 486x648 resolution 
### exposure time = 1ms
one_cam < four_cams (single_processor) = four_cams (Mutil_processors)
<p float="left">
  <img src="images/486x648_1ms_one_cam.png" width="25%" />
  <img src="images/486x648_1ms_four_cam.png" width="25%" /> 
  <img src="images/486x648_1ms_four_cam_mp.png" width="25%" />
</p>

### exposure time = 10ms
one_cam = four_cams (single_processor) = four_cams (Mutil_processors)
<p float="left">
  <img src="images/486x648_10ms_one_cam.png" width="25%" />
  <img src="images/486x648_10ms_four_cam.png" width="25%" /> 
  <img src="images/486x648_10ms_four_cam_mp.png" width="25%" />
</p>

### exposure time = 50ms
one_cam = four_cams (single_processor) = four_cams (Mutil_processors)
<p float="left">
  <img src="images/486x648_50ms_one_cam.png" width="25%" />
  <img src="images/486x648_50ms_four_cam.png" width="25%" /> 
  <img src="images/486x648_50ms_four_cam_mp.png" width="25%" />
</p>

### exposure time = 100ms
one_cam vs four_cams (single_processor) vs four_cams (Mutil_processors)
<p float="left">
  <img src="images/486x648_100ms_one_cam.png" width="25%" />
  <img src="images/486x648_100ms_four_cam.png" width="25%" /> 
  <img src="images/486x648_100ms_four_cam_mp.png" width="25%" />
</p>

## 1944x2592 resolution (one_cam vs four_cams (single_processor) vs four_cams (Mutil_processors))
### exposure time = 1ms
### exposure time = 10ms
### exposure time = 50ms
### exposure time = 1000ms





# camera install
1.Download camera driver [MVSDK.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dOPPfzYnEUw4YZTecg1AgWz3LiztlIDF/view)

2.Install the driver
```bash
unzip MVSDK.zip
cd MVSDK
sudo ./install.sh
```
Please refer to MVSDK/LinuxSDK Document.pdf if you meet any problem while installing.

3.To access the camera dirver, you need add "sudo" for every run. such as
```bash
sudo python cam.py
```
For convenient, you can add current user to the root to avoid add "sudo" for every time.

```bash
secUser=`who am i | awk '{print $1}'` 
sudo adduser $secUser root
sudo udevadm control --reload
sudo udevadm trigger
```
