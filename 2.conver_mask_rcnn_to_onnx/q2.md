Please clone [**Global Tracking Transformers**](https://github.com/xingyizhou/GTR#readme)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xingyizhou/GTR.git --recurse-submodules
```

GTR is mask-rcnn based model for tracking. its tracking transformer is a head of it just like box and mask heads. 


Due to Mask-rcnn has a NMS between the proposal network and its heads, and it is challenge to conevrt it to onnx. 


If possible we'd like to convert data flow within the 
```bash
    def inference(
        self,
        batched_inputs: Tuple[Dict[str, torch.Tensor]],
        detected_instances: Optional[List[Instances]] = None,
        do_postprocess: bool = True,
    ):
```
of GTR/gtr/modeling/meta_arch/custom_rcnn.py to onnx
